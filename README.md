Digital Marketing A/B Testing

Business Context:

A marketing company is conducting an A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising campaign. The test compares user behavior between those who saw advertisements (Ad group) versus those who saw public service announcements (PSA group).

Key Questions to Address:
Campaign Effectiveness:

What is the conversion lift attributable to the advertising?
Is there a statistically significant difference in conversion rates between ad and PSA groups?
What is the effect size (how much better/worse did the ad group perform)?
What is the confidence interval for difference in conversion rates if it exists?
ROI(Return on Investment) Assessment:

How much additional revenue can be expected from using ads vs PSAs?
